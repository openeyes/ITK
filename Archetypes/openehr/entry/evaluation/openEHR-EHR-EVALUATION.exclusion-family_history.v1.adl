			use = <"Use to record the positive exclusion or absence of problems or diagnoses in related family members within the health record. This archetype avoids the need to use terminology to express negation for any problem or diagnosis within the health record or that it is not about the patient themselves.
This archetype is only to be used to record 'point in time' information. It is not to be used for a persistent storage of information as the patient should always be questioned about the occurrence of problems or diagnoses in family members during history taking and prior to initiation of any treatment or management plan.">
