Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' archetype.

Use as a container archetype - to provide a common, queryable ENTRY archetype in which specific, detailed CLUSTER examination archetypes can be nested. Examples of CLUSTER examination archetypes include those that detail the inspection, palpation, auscultation, percussion and movement of identified parts of the body.

This archetype may be specialised for to support specific examination findings requirements, such as OBSERVATION.exam-ear.">
